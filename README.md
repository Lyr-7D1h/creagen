# PLotter ART

# Ideas

- Vector fields
- Flocking
- coloring
  - different color layers of an image each with a small offset
- 3d space
- randomization
  - different probability distributions (PMFs)
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution
- add graphs
- Valid QR that is a link to the creation of the plot
- Use music/audio as input for art
  - Use a song as probability distribution
